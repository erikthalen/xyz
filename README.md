# xyz

To formulate and develop a project that will act as a learning  
as well as a showcase to our peers.  

## desired outcome

- Become good at everything web-3d.  
- Create a case that act as a selling point for potential future 3d-projects.  
- Start making 3d experiences within office hours. (yay!)  

## process

There are two tracks to this project:  

1. Going through the lessons on threejs-journey.
2. Applying the learnings to a made-up case.

The outcome of 2. lives in this repo. From here on out called the "experiment"  
Before any work start the idea for what to make must be defined.  

### prerequisites

- The experiment must adhere to our clients.  
- Presumably by solving a problem they have.  

To come up with and define this problem, a double diamond can be used:  

### <><>

*tl;dr:  
Formulate a problem.  
Come up with a lot of solutions.  
Narrow those done to one.  
Come up with a lot of designs.  
Develop the best one.*

- **Discover.** The first diamond helps people understand,  
rather than simply assume, what the problem is.  
It involves speaking to and spending time with  
people who are affected by the issues.  

- **Define.** The insight gathered from the discovery phase  
can help you to define the challenge in a different way.  

- **Develop.** The second diamond encourages people to give  
different answers to the clearly defined problem,  
seeking inspiration from elsewhere and co-designing with  
a range of different people.  

- **Deliver.** Delivery involves testing out different solutions at  
small-scale, rejecting those that will not work and  
improving the ones that will.  

## workflow

1 day per week for 4 weeks.  
Push/pull to this repo.
